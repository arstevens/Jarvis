<h2>Jarvis lab assistant using Amazon echo and AWS lambda.
How to create a lambda function in
Python that can be used in an Alexa Skill.</h2>

<h2>AlexaBaseHandler class</h2>

The AlexaBaseHandler class is an abstract class that provides the framework
to build the necessary response hooks for an Alexa application.

<h3>process_request</h3>
This method will take the 2 parameters that are sent to the lambda function
and determine which of the Alexa handlers to invoke.

<h3>_build_speechlet_response</h3>
This method ( from the Alexa color example ) will put together the speechlet portion
into a properly formatted json message.  This is typically called by the
concrete implementations of the AlexaBaseHandler.

<h3>_build_response</h3>
This method (from the Alexa color example ) will construct a property formatted
response message so the Amazon Echo knows what to reponse with.

<h2>AlexaDeploymentHandler class</h2>
This class is a reference implementation that does nothing useful.  All Alexa
handlers are handled the same way.

<h2>main.py</h2>
This file contains the main entry point of the lambda function that is called
for the Alexa skill.

<h3>lambda_handler(event, context)</h3>
This method ( which can be called anything, you just need to configure it in
the lambda handler ), is the method that is called with the 2 parameters.

This method will typically instantiate an concrete implementation of the
AlexaBaseHandler and delegate to the process_request method.

<h2>requirements.txt</h2>
This file is the standard Python requirements file.  This file is used by the
create_deployment.py script to install the necessary 3rd party libraries that
your Alexa skill might need.  Any library specified in the requirements.txt
file will be installed into your deployment directory.

<h2>create_deployment</h2>
This script creates a zip file per the Amazon lambda specification, such that
it is suitable to upload as your lambda function implementation.

All deployments are stored in the deployments subdirectory and follow the naming
convention of 'deployment_n' and 'deployment_n.zip', where 'n' is automatically
calculated to the next largest 'n' in the directory.  Right now it does this
based on the name of the subdirectories of deployments - NOT - the names of
the zip files.

The deployment script will create a deployment directory and zip file for
everything in the requirements.txt file AND the files in the <code>deployment_files</code>
variable in the create_deployment.py file.

When this script is done running, there should be a 'deploment_n.zip' file in the deployments directory.
It is that file that needs to be upload to the Amazon Lambda console.
